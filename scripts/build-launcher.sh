# made by scripts/release-launcher.sh into launcher/dist/. Leftovers that would show up as a second
# launcher (an old .dmg in target/, LaunchServices entries for disk images Tauri mounted while
# building one) are removed.
#
# With --dev it builds the development launcher instead, "Azura (DEV).app": tauri.dev.conf.json
# gives it its own name, bundle identifier (so its data lives apart), icon with a DEV band and
# window title, and the `dev` feature gives it its own default saves folder and turns its updater
# off. It installs next to the published launcher without touching it.
#
# Usage: scripts/build-launcher.sh [--dev]
