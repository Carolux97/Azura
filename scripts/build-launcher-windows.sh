# Builds the Azura Launcher for Windows (x86-64) from Linux, into launcher/dist/windows/:
#
#   - Azura Launcher_<version>_x64-setup.exe, the installer (NSIS): it installs the launcher for the
#     current user, without administrator rights, adds it to the Start menu and to Windows' installed
#     apps, from where its uninstaller removes it. The uninstaller offers to delete the launcher's
#     data too (%APPDATA%\com.gears3azura.launcher, and its interface cache in %LOCALAPPDATA%);
#     saves in Documents are never touched;
#   - azura-launcher.exe, the launcher alone, to run without installing.
#
# Only the launcher: the game has no Windows kit or runtime yet, so in Windows the launcher opens
# but cannot build or start the game. The .exe imports only system DLLs (the interface and the
# WebView2 loader are inside it); Windows 10 and 11 bring the WebView2 runtime it shows the
# interface with. It is not signed, so SmartScreen warns the first time it is opened.
#
# How it cross-builds (the only package from apt is nsis, for makensis):
#   - cargo-xwin (installed with cargo when missing) downloads Microsoft's CRT and Windows SDK to
#     its cache (about 1.1 GB, once; set XWIN_CACHE_DIR to put it elsewhere) and points the build
#     at them;
#   - clang-cl, llvm-lib and llvm-rc compile the C parts and the Windows resources: they come from
#     the newest /usr/lib/llvm-N with all three;
#   - the linker is rustup's rust-lld, which links as Microsoft's linker when called lld-link
#     (a link to it in the build folder), so lld does not need to be installed;
#   - `tauri build --runner cargo-xwin` builds through cargo-xwin and makes the installer with
#     makensis, with the settings in bundle.windows.nsis of tauri.conf.json.
#
# Usage: scripts/build-launcher-windows.sh
