//! Launcher self-update, on top of Tauri's updater plugin.
//!
//! The plugin reads `latest.json` from the endpoint in `tauri.conf.json` (a release asset of the
//! releases repository), compares its version with the running one and, when newer, downloads the
//! update archive and checks its signature against the public key in the config before replacing
//! the app. `scripts/release-launcher.sh` and `scripts/publish-launcher.sh` produce both files.
//!
//! The game runtime is not downloaded: it is built on the player's machine from their own copy of
//! the game. A new launcher brings a new player kit, and the builder then rebuilds or relinks the
//! runtime from it (`builder.rs`).
