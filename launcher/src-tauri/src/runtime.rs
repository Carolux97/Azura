//! Starts the game runtime and relays its output to the interface.
//!
//! The runtime is the recompiled game executable, `azura`. It lives in the `runtime` folder of the
//! app data folder, next to the `azura.toml` the launcher writes, because the runtime reads its
//! settings from beside its own executable (`install.rs` puts it there).
//!
//! The folders for saves and for the shader cache are passed on the command line
//! (`--user_data_root`, `--cache_root`): the runtime picks them before it reads `azura.toml`, so
//! the config file cannot set them. The game folder goes on the command line too
//! (`--game_data_root`), so starting does not depend on `azura.toml` having been written.
//!
//! While the game runs, every line it prints is sent to the interface as a `game-output` event,
//! and its end as a `game-exit` event, so the interface can show a live log and explain a failed
//! start. The end is only reported once the game's last lines have been sent, so the log never
//! shows output after the game has ended.
//!
//! Some settings only apply when the game starts, and the game offers to restart when they change.
//! The runtime is started with `AZURA_LAUNCHER=1`, which tells it to leave the restart to the
//! launcher: it exits with `RESTART_EXIT_CODE`, and the launcher starts it again with the same
//! command, sending a `game-restart` event instead of `game-exit`. The game stays a child of the
//! launcher, so its output and its end keep being followed.
