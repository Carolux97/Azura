//! Builds the runtime on the player's machine from their own default.xex
//! (docs/player-runtime-build.md, sections 5 and 8).
//!
//! The recompiled game cannot be distributed, so the launcher builds it here, with the player kit
//! (`scripts/build-kit.sh`) and the machine's C++ compiler (`toolchain.rs`). The kit's `kit.json`
//! holds the commands, recorded from the project's own CMake build with placeholders this module
//! fills in. In order:
//!
//! 1. **Preparing**: the compiler, the kit, the game build (its manifest), free disk space.
//! 2. **Translating**: the kit's code generator turns the game's PowerPC code into C++, in a work
//!    folder under the app data folder (`build/<game build>/`). It only rewrites the files whose
//!    content changes.
//! 3. **Compiling**: the generated precompiled header, then every generated file, one compiler per
//!    core. Each object has a key beside it: a hash of its source, the command, the precompiled
//!    header and every generated header the compiler reported it included (`-MD`, as Ninja
//!    tracks them). A file whose object has the same key is not compiled again, so an interrupted
//!    build resumes where it stopped and a rebuild only compiles what codegen changed. Keys go by
//!    content, not time: the generated code is deleted after a build, and codegen writes every
//!    file again the next time.
//! 4. **Linking**: our compiled code (in the kit) with the generated objects and the SDK
//!    libraries, into a new runtime folder with the staged files (libraries, assets, settings).
//! 5. **Installing**: the new folder replaces the runtime folder by two renames, keeping the
//!    player's `azura.toml` and logs. A build that fails before this step leaves the installed
//!    runtime as it was; an interruption between the renames is repaired by `recover`.
//!
//! Every command's output goes to `build.log` in the work folder, and progress goes to the
//! interface as `runtime-build-progress` events.
